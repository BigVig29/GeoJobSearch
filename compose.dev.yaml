#Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
#With Docker Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services, networks, volumes, and other resources.

version: '3.8'  # Specifies the Docker Compose file version which determines the features available

#This section defines the containers that make up your application. Each service represents a container with its configuration
services:  # Defines the services that make up the application
